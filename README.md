# My First Component Library

Welcome to my first component library! The library is divided into the following component categories:

- Buttons
- Forms
- Checkboxes
- Number Inputs
- Text Inputs with Button
- Select Input Forms

## Technologies Used

- Storybook
- React

## Challenges

The main challenge in this project was making the components focused, independent, reusable, small, and testable (FIRST). The FIRST framework is a helpful tool to think about how code can be as small as it needs to be in order to perform its function well. Once the functionality is there, then it's mainly styling from there!
